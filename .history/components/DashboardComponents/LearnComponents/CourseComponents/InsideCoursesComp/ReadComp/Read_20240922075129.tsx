                <p>Gray Code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ by only one bit, which is useful in error correction and minimizing transitions in digital circuits. We'll cover how to convert binary numbers to Gray Code and vice versa, and discuss practical applications such as reducing error rates in digital communications and simplifying logic circuits. Next, we'll delve into efficient computation with bitsets, highlighting their memory efficiency and rapid bitwise operations. We'll see how bitsets can represent large sets and facilitate fast membership testing, and demonstrate their implementation in C++, including operations like set, reset, flip, and advanced set operations like intersection and union.</p>
